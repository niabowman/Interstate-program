# Interstate-program

Primary U.S. interstate highways are numbered 1-99. Auxiliary highways are numbered 100-999, and service the primary highway indicated by the rightmost two digits. This program takes a interstate highway number and outputs whether it is a primary or auxiliary highway. If auxiliary, this program indicates what primary highway it serves. This program also indicates if the (primary) highway runs north/south or east/west.
